        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </header>
      <p>As we know from the chapter Data types, there are seven language types in JavaScript. Six of them are called “primitive”,
        because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever). In contrast, objects are
        used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost
        every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else. An object can
        be created with figure brackets
        <code>{…}</code> with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property
        name”), and value can be anything. We can imagine an object as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is
        stored in its file by the key. It’s easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.</p>
      <p>An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:</p>
      <pre><code>
    let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
    let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
  </code></pre>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Literals_and_properties">
      <header>
        <h2>Literals and properties</h2>
      </header>
      <p>We can immediately put some properties into
        <code>{...}</code> as “key: value” pairs:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = {     // an object
      name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
      age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
    };
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>A property has a key (also known as “name” or “identifier”) before the colon ":" and a value to the right of it. In
        the user object, there are two properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first property has the name
          <code>"name"</code> and the value
          <code>"John"</code>.</li>
        <li>The second one has the name
          <code>"age"</code> and the value
          <code>30</code>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The resulting user object can be imagined as a cabinet with two signed files labeled “name” and “age”.</p>
      <p>We can add, remove and read files from it any time. Property values are accessible using the dot notation:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    // get fields of the object:
    alert( user.name ); // John
    alert( user.age ); // 30
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>The value can be of any type. Let’s add a boolean one:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    user.isAdmin = true;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>To remove a property, we can use
        <code>delete</code> operator:</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
    delete user.age;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      "likes birds": true  // multiword property name must be quoted
    };
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>The last property in the list may end with a comma:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
    }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>That is called a “trailing” or “hanging” comma. Makes it easier to add/remove/move around properties, because all lines
        become alike.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Square_brackets">
      <header>
        <h2>Square brackets</h2>
      </header>
      <p>For multiword properties, the dot access doesn’t work:</p>

      <pre>
          <code>
    // this would give a syntax error
    user.likes birds = true
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        That’s because the dot requires the
        <code>key</code> to be a valid variable identifier. That is: no spaces and other limitations. There’s an alternative “square bracket
        notation” that works with any string:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = {};

    // set
    user["likes birds"] = true;
    
    // get
    alert(user["likes birds"]); // true
    
    // delete
    delete user["likes birds"];
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Now everything is fine. Please note that the string inside the brackets is properly quoted (any type of quotes will do).
        Square brackets also provide a way to obtain the property name as the result of any expression – as opposed to a
        literal string – like from a variable as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let key = "likes birds";

    // same as user["likes birds"] = true;
    user[key] = true;
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Here, the variable key may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to access the property.
        That gives us a great deal of flexibility. The dot notation cannot be used in a similar way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance:
      </p>
      <pre> 
          <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
    
    let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");
    
    // access by variable
    alert( user[key] ); // John (if enter "name")
          </code>
        </pre>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Property_value_shorthand">
      <header>
        <h2>Property value shorthand</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        In real code we often use existing variables as values for property names.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    function makeUser(name, age) {
      return {
        name: name,
        age: age
        // ...other properties
      };
    }
    
    let user = makeUser("John", 30);
    alert(user.name); // John
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        In the example above, properties have the same names as variables. The use-case of making a property from a variable is so
        common, that there’s a special property value shorthand to make it shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of
        <code>name:name</code> we can just write name, like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    function makeUser(name, age) {
      return {
        name, // same as name: name
        age   // same as age: age
        // ...
      };
    }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        We can use both normal properties and shorthands in the same object:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = {
      name,  // same as name:name
      age: 30
    };
          </code>
        </pre>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Existance_check">
      <header>
        <h2>Existance check</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        A notable objects feature is that it’s possible to access any property. There will be no error if the property doesn’t exist!
        Accessing a non-existing property just returns
        <code>undefined</code>. It provides a very common way to test whether the property exists – to get it and compare vs undefined:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = {};

    alert( user.noSuchProperty === undefined ); // true means "no such property"
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        There also exists a special operator "in" to check for the existence of a property.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax is:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    "key" in object
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        For instance:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = { name: "John", age: 30 };

    alert( "age" in user ); // true, user.age exists
    alert( "blabla" in user ); // false, user.blabla doesn't exist
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Please note that on the left side of in there must be a property name. That’s usually a quoted string. If we omit quotes,
        that would mean a variable containing the actual name to be tested. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = { age: 30 };

    let key = "age";
    alert( key in user ); // true, takes the name from key and checks for such property
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Usually, the strict comparison
        <code>"=== undefined"</code> check works fine. But there’s a special case when it fails, but
        <code>"in"</code> works correctly. It’s when an object property exists, but stores undefined:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let obj = {
      test: undefined
    };
    
    alert( obj.test ); // it's undefined, so - no such property?
    
    alert( "test" in obj ); // true, the property does exist!
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        In the code above, the property
        <code>obj.test</code> technically exists. So the in operator works right. Situations like this happen very rarely, because undefined is
        usually not assigned. We mostly use null for “unknown” or “empty” values. So the in operator is an exotic guest in
        the code.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="The_for...in_loop">
      <header>
        <h2>The for...in loop</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop:
        <code>for..in</code>. This is a completely different thing from the
        <code>for(;;)</code> construct that we studied before.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    for(key in object) {
      // executes the body for each key among object properties
    }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        For instance, let’s output all properties of user:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      isAdmin: true
    };
    
    for(let key in user) {
      // keys
      alert( key );  // name, age, isAdmin
      // values for the keys
      alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true
    }
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Note that all “for” constructs allow us to declare the looping variable inside the loop, like
        <code>let key</code> here. Also, we could use another variable name here instead of
        <code>key</code>. For instance,
        <code>"for(let prop in obj)"</code> is also widely used.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Copying_by_reference">
      <header>
        <h2>Copying by reference</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        One of the fundamental differences of objects vs primitives is that they are stored and copied “by reference”. Primitive
        values: strings, numbers, booleans – are assigned/copied “as a whole value”. For instance:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let message = "Hello!";
    let phrase = message;
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        As a result we have two independent variables, each one is storing the string "Hello!".
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are not like that. A variable stores not the object itself, but its “address in memory”, in other words “a reference”
        to it. Here’s the picture for the object:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John"
    };
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Here, the object is stored somewhere in memory. And the variable user has a “reference” to it. When an object variable is
        copied – the reference is copied, the object is not duplicated. If we imagine an object as a cabinet, then a variable
        is a key to it. Copying a variable duplicates the key, but not the cabinet itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = { name: "John" };

    let admin = user; // copy the reference
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        Now we have two variables, each one with the reference to the same object:
      </p>
      <p>
        We can use any variable to access the cabinet and modify its contents:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
    let user = { name: 'John' };

    let admin = user;
    
    admin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the "admin" reference
    
    alert(user.name); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the "user" reference
          </code>
        </pre>
      <p>
        The example above demonstrates that there is only one object. As if we had a cabinet with two keys and used one of them (admin)
        to get into it. Then, if we later use the other key (user) we would see changes.
      </p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Cloning_and_merging,_Object.assign">
      <header>
        <h2>Cloning and merging, Object.assign</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        So, copying an object variable creates one more reference to the same object. But what if we need to duplicate an object?
        Create an independent copy, a clone? That’s also doable, but a little bit more difficult, because there’s no built-in
        method for that in JavaScript. Actually, that’s rarely needed. Copying by reference is good most of the time. But
        if we really want that, then we need to create a new object and replicate the structure of the existing one by iterating
        over its properties and copying them on the primitive level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
    
    let clone = {}; // the new empty object
    
    // let's copy all user properties into it
    for (let key in user) {
      clone[key] = user[key];
    }
    
    // now clone is a fully independant clone
    clone.name = "Pete"; // changed the data in it
    
    alert( user.name ); // still John in the original object
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Also we can use the method Object.assign for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax is:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    Object.assign(dest[, src1, src2, src3...])
        </code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arguments dest, and src1, ..., srcN (can be as many as needed) are objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          It copies the properties of all objects src1, ..., srcN into dest. In other words, properties of all arguments starting from
          the 2nd are copied into the 1st. Then it returns dest.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For instance, we can use it to merge several objects into one:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = { name: "John" };

    let permissions1 = { canView: true };
    let permissions2 = { canEdit: true };
    
    // copies all properties from permissions1 and permissions2 into user
    Object.assign(user, permissions1, permissions2);
    
    // now user = { name: "John", canView: true, canEdit: true }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        If the receiving object (user) already has the same named property, it will be overwritten:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = { name: "John" };

    // overwrite name, add isAdmin
    Object.assign(user, { name: "Pete", isAdmin: true });
    
    // now user = { name: "Pete", isAdmin: true }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        We also can use Object.assign to replace the loop for simple cloning:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };
    
    let clone = Object.assign({}, user);
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        It copies all properties of user into the empty object and returns it. Actually, the same as the loop, but shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until now we assumed that all properties of user are primitive. But properties can be references to other objects. What to
        do with them?
      </p>
      <p>
        Like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      sizes: {
        height: 182,
        width: 50
      }
    };
    
    alert( user.sizes.height ); // 182
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Now it’s not enough to copy clone.sizes = user.sizes, because the user.sizes is an object, it will be copied by reference.
        So clone and user will share the same sizes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    let user = {
      name: "John",
      sizes: {
        height: 182,
        width: 50
      }
    };
    
    let clone = Object.assign({}, user);
    
    alert( user.sizes === clone.sizes ); // true, same object
    
    // user and clone share sizes
    user.sizes.width++;       // change a property from one place
    alert(clone.sizes.width); // 51, see the result from the other one
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        To fix that, we should use the cloning loop that examines each value of user[key] and, if it’s an object, then replicate
        its structure as well. That is called a “deep cloning”.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a standard algorithm for deep cloning that handles the case above and more complex cases, called the Structured cloning
        algorithm. In order not to reinvent the wheel, we can use a working implementation of it from the JavaScript library
        lodash, the method is called _.cloneDeep(obj).

        Objects are associative arrays with several special features.
      </p>
      <p>
        They store properties (key-value pairs), where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
        </li>
        <li>
          Values can be of any type.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To access a property, we can use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The dot notation: obj.property.
        </li>
        <li>
          Square brackets notation obj["property"]. Square brackets allow to take the key from a variable, like obj[varWithKey].
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additional operators:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To delete a property: delete obj.prop.
        </li>
        <li>
          To check if a property with the given key exists: "key" in obj.
        </li>
        <li>
          To iterate over an object: for(let key in obj) loop.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Objects are assigned and copied by reference. In other words, a variable stores not the “object value”, but a “reference”
        (address in memory) for the value. So copying such a variable or passing it as a function argument copies that reference,
        not the object. All operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same
        single object.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a “real copy” (a clone) we can use Object.assign or _.cloneDeep(obj).
      </p>
      <p>
        What we’ve studied in this chapter is called a “plain object”, or just Object.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many other kinds of objects in JavaScript:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Array to store ordered data collections,
        </li>
        <li>
          Date to store the information about the date and time,
        </li>
        <li>
          Error to store the information about an error.
        </li>
        <li>
          …And so on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They have their special features that we’ll study later. Sometimes people say something like “Array type” or “Date type”,
        but formally they are not types of their own, but belong to a single “object” data type. And they extend it in various
        ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects in JavaScript are very powerful. Here we’ve just scratched the surface of a topic that is really huge. We’ll be closely
        working with objects and learning more about them in further parts of the tutorial.
